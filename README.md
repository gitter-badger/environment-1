**environment** packs all the tooling and configuration I need on a computer in order to program.

```bash
./setup/dev      # Setups the directory structure for projects.
./setup/osx      # Setups the tools. debian is an alternative script used on Debian machines.
./setup/dotfiles # Setups tools' configuration.
```
